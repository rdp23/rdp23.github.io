This is my first attempt at setting up something resembling my own website  


I am a student of Electrical Engineering. My interests range from Neuroscience to Machine Learning to Hardware Design. 
Being an avid reader, I come across a lot of interesting material. 
I plan to pen down here, my exegeses of the articles and research papers I come across and read about.
