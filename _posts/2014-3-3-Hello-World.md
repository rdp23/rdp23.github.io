This is my first attempt at setting up something resembling my own website. I am a student of Electrical Engineering. My interests range from Neuroscience to Machine Learning to Hardware Design. As an avid reader, I plan to pen down here, my exegeses of the interesting articles and research papers I come across.

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
